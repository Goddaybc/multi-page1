                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
                <p>So how do we nurture our ideas so they'll succeed in the world?
                    Many of us struggle with how to communicate ideas effectively, how
                    to get our ideas to make a difference. A biology teacher spends an
                    hour explaining mitosis, and a week later only three kids remember
                    what it is. A manager makes a speech unveiling a new strategy as the
                    staffers nod their heads enthusiastically, and the next day the frontline
                    employees are observed cheerfully implementing the old one.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It's like discussing the attributes of a great basketball player. You
                        can be pretty sure that any great player has some subset of traits like
                        height, speed, agility, power, and court sense. But you don't need all
                        of these traits in order to be great: Some great guards are five feet ten
                        and scrawny. And having all the traits doesn't guarantee greatness: No
                        doubt there are plenty of slow, clumsy seven-footers. It's clear,
                        though, that if you're on the neighborhood court, choosing your team
                        from among strangers, you should probably take a gamble on the
                        seven-foot dude.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>How do we find the essential core of our ideas? A successful defense
                            lawyer says, "If you argue ten points, even if each is a good point,
                            when they get back to the jury room they won't remember any." To
                            strip an idea down to its core, we must be masters of exclusion. We
                            must relentlessly prioritize. Saying something short is not the missionâ€”
                            sound bites are not the ideal. Proverbs are the ideal. We must
                            create ideas that are both simple and profound. The Golden Rule is
                            the ultimate model of simplicity: a one-sentence statement so profound
                            that an individual could spend a lifetime learning to follow it.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>How do we get people to care about our ideas? We make them feel
                                something. In the case of movie popcorn, we make them feel dis
                                gusted by its unhealthiness.</p>
